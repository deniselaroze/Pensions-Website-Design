README

This folder in the Github repository contains the replication code and data for the manuscript titled "Improving Pension Information: Experimental Evidence on Learning using Online Resources".

The folder titled "Online" contains the code and data for the online version of the experiment. It includes the following subfolders:

* Online Data: This contains the various data files that are merged during the data analysis process.
* Output: This folder contains all the figures and tables exported by the R files.
* R: Here you will find the R code used to merge, manage, and analyze the data.
- To replicate the sections of the manuscript related to the online experiment, please execute the "main_online.R" file.


The "Lab" file also contains similar information as the other folder and additionally includes the replication material for the emotion analysis.

 - To replicate the sections of the manuscript related to the lab experiment, execute the "main_lab.R" file. 
 - Before switching from the online to the lab replication, restart R, as there are packages used in the data analysis sections that are incompatible with the merge file.
